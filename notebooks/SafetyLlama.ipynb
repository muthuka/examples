      "The Supreme Court in this case applied a broad interpretation of the term 'State' under Article 12 of the Constitution. The Court reasoned that a government company undertaking public functions qualifies as 'State' based on factors like government control, public importance of activities etc. This was in line with previous judgments that have defined 'State' under Article 12 broadly to include various agencies and instrumentalities beyond just statutory bodies. The Court also applied the principle that unreasonable and arbitrary contractual terms can be struck down under Article 14 of the Constitution. The Court found that Rule 9(i) of the service rules, which allowed for termination of service without reason, conferred unfettered power to terminate employment without hearing. This was deemed arbitrary and violative of principles of natural justice and right to equality under Article 14. The Court also held that the right to livelihood under Article 21 is affected by arbitrary termination of employment. The Court reasoned that the right to livelihood is an integral part of the right to life under Article 21 and any arbitrary action that affects a person's livelihood would be a violation of Article 21.\n"
